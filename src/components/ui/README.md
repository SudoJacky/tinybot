# Shared UI
<!-- tinybot-module-fingerprint: sha256:f9b922f8812aa3411569cb12c9147ca96340937a3d4d683499c18cf7315f8772 -->

`components/ui` contains reusable renderer UI whose interface is not owned by
a single route. It includes the shared chat composer, file metadata formatting,
and desktop-level modal interaction behavior. Composer file references retain
the optional managed-image content hash while keeping preview and removal
interaction independent from native storage.

Route orchestration and domain-specific state stay in `react-workbench` and
`app-core`; shared UI receives data and actions through explicit props.

`useModalDialog` is the shared seam for modal focus, keyboard navigation,
background dismissal, focus restoration, and body scroll locking. Route-owned
dialogs keep their visual structure and domain actions local.
