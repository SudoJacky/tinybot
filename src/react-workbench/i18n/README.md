# Renderer Internationalization
<!-- tinybot-module-fingerprint: sha256:89d218a7949a7bfb6ba36ac75ffd37e75fd62ebab2b98375bd00f7f86b8c909d -->

`i18n` configures `i18next` for the React renderer and owns the typed English
and Chinese resource bundles.

User-visible copy belongs in `resources/`. Domain identifiers, persisted
values, protocol fields, and diagnostic codes must remain language-neutral.
The retired TinyOS application namespace is intentionally absent. Sidecar copy
lives under the owning `chat` route namespace, including Terminal shell
selection, process state, availability, and user-only ownership labels.
The Performance Trace route, diagnostic-mode controls, local-export status, and
privacy warning follow the same English and Simplified Chinese resource
boundary; metric and event identifiers remain untranslated.
